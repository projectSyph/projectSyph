    A console turn based game with support for 2 (1v1), 3 (each for themselves) or 4 (2v2) players.
    The program begins with a choice for a new game, options menu, credits (where we will put our names and githubs), a guide menu (we will explain how to play the game there) and exit.
    Players enter their names when they choose new game/
    
    Everyone has an inventory and souls (they begin with 8000). You can trade your souls to spawn creatures (we must think of a few kinds, put suggestions in the new file) or cause different disasters (windstorms, plagues, etc.) to happen (they will still require souls, and sometimes even sacrifices).

    To spawn a creature you will need x souls and each will get 40% health, 20% armor, 20% energy, 20% souls (e.g. if you have spent 1000 souls for a creature it will have 400 health, 200 armor, 200 energy, 200 souls) and its attack will be equal to ¼ of the souls needed for its spawning. Each kind of monster will have different attack

    When a creature attacks it requires 10 energy. If energy drops <= 0 the creature loses 80% of its current health and 100% of its armor.

    When a creature attacks 3 things can happen: 
-- if its attack is higher than the opponent’s, its attack is removed from its opponent’s armor first, and health second (e.g. your monster has 250 attack, opponent has 100 attack 200 health, 100 armor; your monster attacks and your opponent loses 100  armor and 150 health).
-- if its attack is equal to the opponent’s, both die.
-- if its attack is less than the opponent, same thing as the first, only reversed

    The game ends when there is only one player (for 2 and 3 players) or only one team (for 4 players) left standing.
    You will be able to save the log of the battle in a .txt file in the Windows Documents directory.
