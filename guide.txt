When you start a new game, you have to enter your username, which will be used for the period of the game.
There can be 2, 3 or 4 players. 
Each player starts with 8000 souls and the goal is to keep them for as long as you can.

You can have different spawns, each with their own attack, health, armor, energy and souls. 
Each creature requires 20 energy to attack.
When its energy drops to zero or below, it loses 80% of its current health and all of its armor.

When your spawn attacks three things can happen:
- If its attack is higher than the opponent's, its attack is removed from the opponent's armor first and health second (e.g if your spawn has 250 attack and its opponent has 100 attack, 200 health and 100 armor, the opponent loses 100 armor and 150 health). If your spawn's oponent's health hits zero, it dies and your spawn takes its souls.

- If your spawn's attack is equal to its opponent's, both die.

- If its attack is lower than the opponent's, it is the same logic as the first, only reversed.

The game ends when there is only one player (when 2 or 3 players) or one team (for 4 players) left standing.
